# Uncommon CSS Bug: Incorrect Class Selector

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked CSS bug: using an incorrect class selector.  The bug involves a simple typo or misunderstanding of the actual class name assigned to an HTML element.

## The Bug
The `bug.css` file contains a CSS rule targeting a class that doesn't exist on the HTML element.  This leads to the intended styling not being applied.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file corrects the class selector to match the actual class name assigned to the HTML element, resolving the styling issue.

This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when writing CSS and double-checking class names.
